## To Do

MAYBE PUT IT AS THE ARGUMENT: **Import the APK**

Get the **virustotal** Info

Get the Manifest

**Quit** (put in TEMP instead of removing Junk)

**Native Files:**
	check where these native files are being called in the code

**Internet Connection:**

- Look for Internet permission
- Look for IPs, URLs, HTTP identifiers

Raise a **Warning message** each time a seemingly malicious info is found
