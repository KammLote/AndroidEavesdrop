## Introduction

##### Is Facebook listening at you ?

##### Is it a coincidence ?

> Mathematics professor David Hand from Imperial College London wrote a book called The Improbability Principle, in which he argued that apparently extraordinary events happen all the time.

##### Other kinds of malwares

These are from the family of **adwares**, but employ a very interesting technique to target the user better and find more valuable/useful ads.

Give other examples of Adwares... how they work in a general basis.

##### Are they legal ?

Why it is "somewhat" legal? How they warn users ? How have they been caught ? What are the laws against these kinds of applications.

#### Famous applications doing such Eavesdropping

##### 1. How to find these applications

Press articles (eg. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html)

Virus Total: same signatures, same detections, same advertisers, permissions ... 

Forums

<br/>

##### 2. Alphonso

Name/URL/libraries triggering it (Android Privacy Risk Alphonso (PUA), inMobi), advertisers (ads.flurry, sponsorpay, supersonicads, jirbo, mopub).,

Taxonimy of Alphonso Software: India, same developpers, dates of parution/modification.

<br/>

##### 3. Silverpush

<br/>

##### 4. Other apps

Chatrious, Apex chat (callerspy malware), Soraka (adware), Mandrake (abfix, coincast, snaptune)

<br/>

<br/>

#### What to look at in order to distinguish an eavesdropping app and a genuine app 

Permission used

How are the permissions requested

Is the application contacting a server ? What is passed to the server.

What is done with the audio ?

Is the audio stored in a database ?

Is the audio recording triggered by user interaction ?

<br/>

- **Static Analysis:** Reverse enginner the application (tedious task, depends on the obfuscation of the application, depends on the size of the code, the libraries used ...)
- **Dynamic Analysis:** launch the application and observe what happens - logs, internet traffic, saved data ... (depends on whether the application can still be run, if the reached servers are still up ... these questions are not necessarily important in the case an application has not been detected as malicious).

## Design and implementation of the tool

30%

#### Utility of the tool

Automate a part of the task (to answer the previously asked questions)

Assistant to the reverse engineering task + to the dynamic analysis

Easy to use

<br/>

#### Tool capabilities

<br/>

#### Tool usage

<br/>

#### Benchmark of the tool 

Evaluate the performance of the tool: Benchmark of the tool, Accuracy performance - including benine and Malicious applications 

Recall all of the benine and malicious components of the applications â€”> give a maliciousness score

Use it on many different applications: false positive and negative

## Case study

#### What are the little particlarities of these app

###### Where is the data treated (on the device, on the server) (is it text to speech, fingerprinting) ?

###### Do they work in the background ?

###### Do they need user input ?

###### How are the permissions granted ?

###### How do they trick the users (the user?

###### What APIs do they use ? (only Android or others ?)

###### How are the ad displayed ? Where do the ads come from ?

Displayed by Google ad libraries, or rewarded ads. How do they link it with the ad name ??

###### How do they check the presence of the user ?

###### What dialog do they initiaite with the server ?

URLs found (*/user/audio_clip_data, /user/location, /audio/fingerprint*), AlphonsoUID + API_Key

###### check this adware analysis content: 

> https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/h/adware-posing-as-85-photography-and-gaming-apps-on-google-play-installed-over-8-million-times.html

###### Why are these apps legit in the way they ask for user pemission ? How do they trick the users ?

> "AlphonsoService cannot be instantiated without microphone permissions" 
> "This app uses audio to detect TV ads and content and shows appropriate mobile ads" 
> "This App Would Like to Access the Microphone"

###### What do they manage to recognize ?

Commercial or LiveTV ? Name episode ... give the charts

###### Native code

Make the speech to fingerprint

###### Default values of the recording: Prime time ...

###### Databases



###### BURP suite
