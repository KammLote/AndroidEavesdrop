### Analyzing permissions misuse in Android Applications

### Malicious Applications
- Android Eavesdropping app, sending audio to create personnalized ad.
- Applications using camera and microphone in the background 
- Applications taking screenshots 

### Permission Management
- Permission granting (asking user permission directly, rooting the device to evade use permissions...)
- Permission management from Android (ask for all permissions for lower APIs, ask for all the requested permissions at downloading time for mid APIs, ask for permissions one by one at downloading and launch time for higher APIs)

### Application examples
- Alphonso Automated Content Recognition
- Apex Chat (callerspy)
- Code4hk/xRAT surveillance apps (root permissions)
